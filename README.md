# REM Audio App

## Requirements:
- Flutter SDK (latest version).
- Android Studio.
- Android dev components (on the official installation guide).

## Installation:
- Open the original [guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
- Select your actual OS and Android development option (recommended one).
- After the process is done, make sure that everything is ok by typing on the command promp "flutter doctor -v".

## Usage:
- You can start the app on the top-right of the screen by clicking on the execution arrow.
- Otherwise you can use the CLI with commands such as "flutter run [--release/debug] [device name]", or simply "flutter run" (executing on selected or default device).
- You can select the deploying device in the bottom-right of the screen, near to the notification menu.
- If any new dependency is added to the project save the "pubspec.yaml" file and it will reload automatically the project.


### Recommendations:
- For better SDK management (multiple apps development, pro users), use Flutter Version Management ([FVM](https://fvm.app/)).
- It is easier to debug over cable or in wireless mode if your device supports it.
